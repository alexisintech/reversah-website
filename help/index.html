        <div class="panel">
        <p>When you placed your order, you should have received a
        confirmation email or text message (depending on which you
        inputted). On this email, you’ll find a tracking link, whether it be for
        USPS, UPS, or DHL. Once your banner is under packaging and
        shipping, this link will update to show when your banner is expected
        to arrive! If the link still hasn’t updated, please check our
        <a href="">ORDER STATUS</a> page to check your order status!</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">What size are the banners?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The product dimensions are 18 inches x 42 inches.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Where do you ship the banners to?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>We currently only ship to the United States and Canada. Once
        COVID-19 restrictions ease down, we’ll resume international
        shipping.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">How long do products take to ship?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>On average, banners take 5-6 weeks from the day you order to the
        shipping day. We complete our process on a biweekly cycle to lower
        costs and make banners cheaper for our customers! For example, if
        you order on Feburary 1st, production won’t begin until around
        February 14th. Production will take approximately two weeks, so you
        can expect to receive your banner in March.
        
        Please take note of this since we cannot cancel orders once they’ve
        entered production. If you are ordering this as a gift, please plan
        accordingly. Again, we <span>CANNOT</span> cancel orders or offer refunds
        once banners enter production. Thank you for understanding!</p>

        <button class="accordion">Will you ever sell in-game banners?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Unfortunately, due to copyright, we cannot sell in-game banners.
        If you’re looking for an agent that isn’t featured on our page, we’re
        currently creating designs for Fade, Chamber, KAY/O, and Breach,
        so please stay tuned!</p>
